lesson and hands-on lab in Python. However, there is one more thing you need to do. The Data Science community encourages sharing work. The best way to share and showcase your work is to share it on GitHub. By sharing your notebook on GitHub you are not only building your reputation with fellow data scientists, but you can also show it off when applying for a job. Even though this was your first piece of work, it is never too early to start building good habits. So, please read and follow <a href=\"https://cognitiveclass.ai/blog/data-scientists-stand-out-by-sharing-your-notebooks/\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> to learn how to share your work.\n","<hr>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FrcrUHSZcWIW"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n","<h2>Get IBM Watson Studio free of charge!</h2>\n","    <p><a href=\"https://cocl.us/PY0101EN_edx_add_bbottom\"><img src=\"https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/Ad/BottomAd.png\" width=\"750\" align=\"center\"></a></p>\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gvC9mRtGcWIX"},"source":["<h3>About the Authors:</h3>  \n","<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-s-50398b136/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Santarcangelo</a> is a Data Scientist at IBM, and holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering.
